"The Park" by "Karl Harris".

The story genre is "Steampunk".  

When play begins, say "'Work has been a killer lately.'  You need a break... something fun and different..."

The entrance is a room.  "A gate manned by a park employee taking tickets breaks a high wall to the north.  Opposite, to the south stretches a huge parking lot full of cars.  Over the wall you can see the brightly colored rides beckoning with the promise of exciting adrenaline rushes."

The turn stile is a door.  The turn stile is north of the entrance and south of the SkyRide.
